# RTS Group Movement

I am <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sandra-alvarez-45453215b/">Sandra Alvarez</a>, student of the <a href="https://www.citm.upc.edu/ing/estudis/graus-videojocs/">Bachelor’s Degree in Video Games by UPC at CITM</a>. This content is generated for the second year’s subject Project 2, under supervision of lecturer <a href="https://es.linkedin.com/in/ricardpillosu">Ricard Pillosu</a>.

_NOTE: although this research focuses mainly on real-time strategy (RTS) games, the methods described can easily be applied to games of other genres._

## Intro to the subject

“Game-unit pathfinding is something that most players never notice until it doesn’t work quite right, and then that minor issue becomes a rage-inducing, end-of-the-world problem” says Patrick Wyatt, a game programmer who worked on _StarCraft_.

Moving troops in groups via complex terrain is a challenge that many games have to deal with, specially real-time strategy games, where hundreds of units compete for the same destinations. The main question is, how do we make units cooperate with each other, so they move around without causing a terrible chaos? While the first part of the answer is pathfinding, the technique of finding paths from one location to another, the second part is movement. Without controlling the movement, units would behave individually, without taking in account the behaviors of the rest of the units. Here is, then, where coordinated movement comes in.

Coordinated movement is the result of combining two processes. The first one is pathfinding, while the second one is movement, the execution of a given path. This is what is intented to achieve in this research.

_Final results of the research_

## How different games have approach it

Before we start to implement our coordinated movement system, we should understand precisely how coordinated movement works. To do so, there is no better way than to take a look at some existing games that have it. First, we will analyse how it is felt in the game (from the player's perspective). Then, we will dive deeper to investigate the method/s behind it.

### Command & Conquer: Tiberian Dawn (1995)

- Units always calculate the shortest route possible, even if this means getting through an enemy's trap. Thus, if units are shot while moving, they don't fire back.
- When a harvester attempts to return to the base while another harvester is going out to collect resources, if their routes share the same narrow path, the two of them will sometimes meet. If they do, they will turn twice (each time continuing to block each other's progress), center their orientation, and finally move right through each other.

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AGtd0KkOvG4?start=400" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe><br>

The shortest distance is determined with algebra, not calculus. Consequently, the resulting path only takes into account the distance from point A to point B, ignoring any obstacles. This makes units overlap each other when they move, but if they do overlap, they will spread out again when reaching their destination.

### Warcraft I (1994) and II (1995)

- Every time a group of defensive units (still units) is attacked, the individual units will move further and further away.
- The armies head straight for their destination, going left or right when they hit something, then giving up after a while.
- It can take a unit 45 seconds to go from one end of the map to the other. In that time, new structures may have been built, making the original path invalid, or trees may have been chopped down, making the original path a very poor choice.
- Units often block each other. E.g.: peasants heading to the gold mine block peasants returning from it, because the only valid path for each group is blocked by the other group.

_Warcraft_ engine is optimized to draw 32x32 pixel square tiles made of 16 8x8 pixel square cells (orthogonal perspective). The camera perspective of _Warcraft I_ and _Warcraft II_ is almost top-down, so the edges of the objects (buildings, etc.) are either horizontal or vertical. This leads to easy pathfinding, because each 32x32 tile is either passable or un-passable.

However, some tiles seem passable but actually are not. For example, the barracks building artwork does not fill completely the 96x96 area it sits on, and it leaves two tiles that seem passable but actually are not.

<img src="Images/Warcraft2.jpg" width="400"><br>

### StarCraft (1998)

- Units stop when they detect an object in front and politely wait for the object to move before continuing along the path.
- Units do not walk on top of each other, even if this means taking longer to get from point A to point B. Consequently, units remain visually separated.
- Harvesting units (Terran SVC, Zerg drone, Protoss probe) would get jammed up trying to harvest crystals or vespene gas (hereafter "minerals") and they would grind to a halt, because they are constantly running headlong into other harvesters traveling in the opposite direction. To avoid this situation, they ignore collisions with other units, so they can operate efficiently.

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0oJPPCaQeD4" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe>
  
_StarCraft_ was built on the _Warcraft_ engine (orthogonal perspective), but along the way the development team switched to isometric artwork to make the game more visually attractive. However, the terrain engine was not re-engineered to use isometric tiles. In order for pathfinding to work properly it was necessary to increase the resolution of the pathfinding map. Now, each 8x8 tile was either passable or unpassable. The increase in the size of the pathfinding map by a factor of 16 involved more computational effort when searching for a path. In addition, diagonal edges drawn in the artwork split many of the square tiles unevenly, making it hard to determine whether a tile should be passable or not.

Because the project was always two months from launch, there was no time to re-engine the terrain engine, so the pathfinding code had to be made to work. The pathfinding code, then, turned into a gigantic state-machine which handled all the tricky edge-cases.

### StarCraft II: Wings of Liberty (2010)

- Units of all sizes find their way to destinations, without overlapping each other and without stopping.
- Smooth flow of the units.

## Methods to approach it (used by the previous games)<br>

### Tile-based algorithm A* (A-Star)

#### Pathfinding technique: A*<br><br>

The games _Command & Conquer: Tiberian Dawn_, _Warcraft: Orcs & Humans_, _Warcraft II: Tides of Darkness_, and _StarCraft_ base their group movement on the tile-based algorithm A* (A-Star). The primitive A* is the most common pathfinding algorithm used by the first RTS games such as the named, which had to deal with much lower processing power. 

#### Movement behavior: set of rules<br><br>

Since the pathfinding algorithm A* only takes into account the terrain (and, if modified, the objects of the map), it has to be complemented by a set of rules, which vary depending on the game and its needs. For example, in _Warcraft II_, a rule says that if a unit runs into other units and cannot slide past them, it will repath an alternate route. This works fine for a samll number of units, but when trying to navigate a large number of units through a narrow passage, a few will inevitably run into the units ahead of them and find another path.
  
As seen, those rules are very limited. In some situations, they force games to sacrify more natural behaviors to make the whole system work. A true shortest path algorithm can be immensely annoying to gameplay, due to human perception. That is a pitfall the game designer must take into consideration when picking an algorithm. From the limitations behind the tile-based algorithm A* when dealing with group movement, it came out the Flocking System with Flow Fields.

### Flow Fields + Flocking (or Swarm) Behavior

The games _StarCraft II: Wings of Liberty_ and _Supreme Commander 2_, and the great majority of modern RTS games use a Flocking System with Flow Fields to maintain fluid control of large groups of units. A local dynamic Flow Field is generated around each unit. The Flow Fields of the units are combined together before adjusting the units' movements.

#### Pathfinding technique: Flow Fields<br><br>

Flow Fields are an alternate way of doing pathfinding which works better for larger groups of units. A Flow Field is a grid where each grid square has a directional vector. This vector should be pointed in the direction of the most efficient way to get to the destination, while avoiding static obstacles.

#### Movement behavior: Flocking (or Swarm)<br><br>

The flocking model was defined by Craig Reynolds, an artificial life and computer graphics expert. Flocks, by definition, are a group of birds traveling together. Reynolds called the generic simulated flocking entities "boids", creating the Boids artificial life simulation (1986). The basic flocking model consists of three simple steering behaviors (separation, alignment and cohesion) which describe how an individual boid moves based on the positions and velocities of its nearby flockmates. As a result, entities in a flock (or boids) travel at roughly the same speed and form a cohesive group without strict arrangement.

The algorithm finds the fewest amount of waypoints and allows autonomous steering behaviour for units to smoothly hug their way around obstacles and its immediate neighbors. Logically, every unit has sensors which, when colliding with another unit, notify the first unit to turn in an appropriate direction to avoid the other unit.

## How we are going to approach it

From the two methods described, we will follow the first one. This means that we are going to implement a set of rules which allows individual units to execute paths (already found by the A* pathfinding algorithm) while moving together as a group. To do so, we will combine the functionalities of two different modules, which are independent from each other, one for each of the components of the group movement:

**1. Pathfinding module.** _Already implemented_.<br>
**2. Movement module.** _Needs to be implemented_.

Since the first one, the Pathfinding module, will be already implemented, we will focus on the implementation of the second one, the Movement module. The Movement module will be in charge of managing groups and units, plus the execution of their individual paths (provided by the Pathfinding module).

### Groups and Units

Once created the Movement module, we have to build two structs, one for managing groups and the other one for managing units. These structs come in handy especially if the game handles groups of units of different types. One group may be the player units and the other one may be the enemy units, so when they cross, units from one grup can start attacking units from the other group.

#### Groups<br>

The UnitGroup contains several units, although the group behaves as a single entity: 
- The units within the group always have close goals.
- There are internal collisions within the units of the group. If any space is left between some of the members of the group, a non-grouped unit can occupy it.

<img src="Images/unitGroup.PNG" width="400"><br>
_Struct for a group of units_

Groups can also have the following properties:
- Maximum speed at which the group can move while still keeping together: it is determined by the speed of the slowest unit, or the slowest unit moves a little faster when it is in a group or has a temporary speed boost in order to catch up.
- Centroid of the group: reference point for the group.
- Commander for the group: unit that does the pathfinding for the group and decides which route the group as a whole takes.

#### Units<br>

The SingleUnit struct is contained by a unit. It handles all the necessary information regarding the unit's movement and keeps it updated. If the unit changes its group, a pointer to the new group will be saved in this struct.

<img src="Images/singleUnit.PNG" width="400"><br>
_Struct for a single unit_

### Simple Movement Algorithm

When a unit is ordered to move, it runs through a state-based movement algorithm. The states of the unit's movement are:<br><br>
**1. Wait for path:** if the unit has a valid goal, a path is requested to the Pathfinding module.<br>
**2. Follow path:** the unit moves from one waypoint of the path to the next one. This state also manages the collision prediction and avoidance for the unit.<br>
**3. Goal reached:** when the unit reaches its goal, it goes to this state.<br>
**4. Increase waypoint:** when the unit reaches its next tile, this state updates the next tile with the next waypoint of the path.

_StarCraft_ relies almost solely on the pathfinding algorithm A* to move units from one point to another, mapping every single node that the unit needs to traverse over. In _StarCraft II_, a lot of the pathfinding is lef up to the unit, and waypoints are kept to minimum.

<img src="Images/movementState.PNG" width="400"><br>
_Enum with all of the possible states of a unit's movement_

#### Implementation<br><br>

**FIRST STEP.** When a unit is issued a command, the parameters of that command (the current location and the destination in the grid) are run through the pathfinding algorithm, which spits out an array of path coordinates (waypoints). The unit stores the path found, which is free of static obstacles (known as unwalkable tiles).

**PROBLEM 1. Shared destination.** If the unit is in a bigger group, only the first unit of the group calculates the path to the goal set by the user. The rest of the units' destinations are offset from that point and calculated after, one at a frame. This prevents the units to finish the path all to the same spot. Besides that, if every unit has its own path to its own unique destination, the whole movement of the group looks more natural, because paths tend to have less waypoints in common. This minimizes the chance of collision between the units along the path.

**SECOND STEP.** The unit moves along the path, but it only goes 1 square at a time, due to the need of local collision determination. Before making the move, the unit just asks the path which direction it's supposed to go next. After that, it tries to move there.

**When is the path recalculated?**
- When a new move command is issued while the unit is en route. This behaviour has given rise to SPAM-CLICKING. The path is literally re-calculated each time you click, so technically a unit is finding the most efficient path at the point of time closest to the click.
- When the next node of the path is occupied by another unit and the treatment of the collision found requires to (the unit is stuck).

**Why do not automatically recalculate the path?**<br><br>
If the path is the most accurate when it is newly created, why do not automatically recalculate it instead of only doing it on click or when a certain type of collision is found? Because the pathfinding algorithm calculations are expensive, even by modern computing standards. Depending on the size of the grid, calculating hundreds of paths for hundreds of units adds up.

Movement is strictly limited to cardinal direction (N, S, E, W, NE, NW, SE, and SW), and units cannot move forward 1 degrees, back 2 degrees, left 3 degrees, etc. This is why the <I>StarCraft</I> movement feels so blocky sometimes. If units moved outside the grid, like in <I>StarCraft II</I>, they would not be able to ask the question “is the node I am walking to occupied?”, which is the core of the local avoidance algorithm that we are going to implement next.

### Collision System

The A* algorithm takes into account only static obstacles. This means that dynamic obstacles like units are ignored when calculating the path. It is in the units' hands to avoid the dynamic obstacles, then. This is achieved with the Collision System, which is made of two smaller systems, the Collision Prediction System (which is run first) and the Collision Avoidance Sytem (which is run only if the Collision Prediction System determines a collision). The Collision System checks for future collisions (opposed to immediate collisions), which are collisions happening at a specific point in the future. It finds out if two units will collide and treats the collision adequately. If all of the future collisions are treated, the risk for immediate collisions is zero.

In _StarCraft_, units are constrained by the fact that they are competing for waypoints. They are constantly stopping and moving because each time they travel to a new node they ask "is the next node that I want to walk to occupied?" to the Collision Prediction System. If the answer is "no", they keep moving along the path. If the answer is "yes", the Collision Avoidance System processes the collision and gives orders to the unit to execute specified commands. Those commands may involve the creation of a new path.

In _Starcraft II_, units avoid obstacles and other units (but also flock together) using steering behaviour. This allows units to weave in and out without calculating a whole new path or losing momentum. In a worst case scenario, the units can even ignore the collision radius, allowing for more fluid movement and higher movement efficiency overall.

#### Implementation<br><br>

**PROBLEM 2. Dealing with dynamic obstacles (moving and still units)**

**THIRD STEP.** Before getting to the next position, units must process this next position through the Collision Prediction System, in order to predict collision with the other units in the environment.<br><br>
**FOURTH STEP.** If a collision is found, the unit has to avoid (before it happens) it by following the rules of the Collision Avoidance System. If there is no collision, then the unit can go on its way.

#### Collision Prediction System (detecting collisions)<br><br>

In each frame of the simulation, each unit needs to check for future collisions with all other units in the scene. This is done by processing the next tile the unit wants to go to through the collision prediction system. The possible situations of collision are:

**1. Two agents reach the same cell (_SameCell_).**<br>
**2. Two agents reach the cell of each other (_TowardsCell_):** occurs if the agents are walking towards each other (in opposite directions).<br>
**3. An agent reaches the cell of another agent (_ItsCell_).**<br>
**4. Two agents cross diagonally, reaching the cell in front of each other (_DiagonalCrossing_).**

<img src="Images/collisionType.PNG" width="400"><br>
_Enum with all of the possible types of collision_

In most RTS, basic collision determination consists of treating all units as spheres (or circles in 2D) and doing a simple spherical collision check. However, we do treat units as points and do the collision check with their next tiles.

#### Collision Avoidance System (resolving collisions)<br><br>

Collision avoidance between units can involve some problems that only appear when we deal with many units, so a method to avoid collision between individuals can be inefficient when we have several ones.

If a collision is predicted, one of the two units involved must act consequently, so it avoids the collision before it happens. Each unit has a priority and several ones could have the same priority, so the unit with the lower priority will always have to let the unit with the higher priority pass. The priority system avoids units to do a merry-go-round dance. The responses to the different situations of collision are:

**1. _SameCell_ (conflict cell: the tile both units want to go to):** the unit waits until the other unit has reached the conflict cell and has updated its next position with the next waypoint of its path.<br>
**2. _TowardsCell_ (conflict cell: any of the two tiles):** since units get stuck, the unit has to find a new next tile to go to and then recalculate its path.<br>
**3. _ItsCell_ (conflict cell: the tile of the other unit):** the unit waits until the other unit is no longer on the conflict cell.<br>
**4. _DiagonalCrossing_ (conflict cell: the tile where the other unit wants to move to):** the unit waits until the other unit has reached the conflict cell.<br>
**5. One of the units is still (conflict cell: the tile of the unit that is still, which is the next tile of the other unit):** if the unit with the higher priority is the unit that is still, it has to find a new goal and start walking towards it. If the unit with the higher priority is the other unit, the one that is walking, it has to find a new next tile to go to and then recalculate its path.<br>

The behavior in the next frame of each unit depends on the type of collision prediction and the type of collision avoidance.

**FIFTH AND LAST STEP.** The unit keeps moving until it reaches its goal.

## Performance

### CPU usage
CPU is not affected by moving a single unit, but the movement of multiple units needs to be extremely conservative in its CPU usage. This is why, before making any decision that may affect the performance of the system, we need to prioritize one of two things. Minimize CPU usage or maximize the intelligence behind the movement?

E.g.: when a unit needs to find a new, valid tile to move to, the possible, valid tiles are checked taking in account its priority. We could calculate this priority as the number of waypoints that the new path would have (maximize the accuracy behind the movement: the new tile would be the accurest tile that could have been found) or as the distance from the new tile to the goal tile (minimize CPU usage: since the unwalkable tiles are ignored, the new tile could be the closest to the goal tile, but not the best option when creating the new path).

### Movement module performance

After a session of profiling, these are the results of the implemented Movement module:

- For 8 units, the Movement module consumes from 0.6 ms to 4 ms (when a unit creates a path).
- For 16 units, the Movement module can have peaks of 20 ms (when a unit creates a path), though it is not noticed at plain sight.
- For 24 units, the Movement module may have peaks of 200 ms (when a unit creates a path), which is completely unacceptable.

To sum up, the Movement module should be used for 8 to 16 units. While it is ideal for 8 units, for 16 units can sometimes consume too much, but still works fine. The main problem that needs to be solved is the pathfinding, because the Movement module collapses only when a unit creates a new path. A solution to this could be to optimize the Pathfinding module, since it is the one causing trouble.

## TODOs

Time to practise! Download the Handout and try to finish the TODOs by your own. If you are stuck in a TODO, you can check it explained in detail down below. With the given Handout, you should be able to create units and select them. However, if you set a destination tile for them, the program should crush.

### TODO 1

#### Solution explained
- The unit has a pointer to a SingleUnit already declared, which is called ‘singleUnit’. It is only needed to initialize it with a new SingleUnit. Since the unit is not a member of a group yet, its group will be nullptr.
- The Movement module has a method to create a group from a given unit. Call it from this unit.

#### What should happen after completing it
You should be able to create units, select them and set a destination tile for them without having the program crush. However, the selected units will not move.

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IkCTjuU-dwY" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe>

### TODO 2

#### Solution explained
- The Movement module has a method to check if a tile is valid. Call it. The goal of the unit is the tile that needs to be checked. Set to true the goalTile check, so the tile will not be valid if it coincides with the goal of another unit.
- If the goal is not valid, update both the goal and the newGoal of the unit with a goal calculated with a method that finds a new valid goal. The goal that must be passed as an argument is the goal of the group, not the unit’s (it could not be valid). The method will expand with a BFS from the goal passed as an argument.

#### What should happen after completing it
If you set a destination tile for the units, you should see the goal tile of each unit drawn on the map.

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yQbKd3JgzO8" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe>

### TODO 3

#### Solution explained
- nextPos is nextTile in map coordinates. By calculating the difference between the nextPos and the current position of the unit, we find the distance that the unit should move to reach nextTile.
- To normalize the movePos, first you need to calculate its norm. After that, divide the movePos by its norm (only if the norm is bigger than zero).
- The unit has a method to set its direction. Set it with the normalized movePos. 
- Multiply the movePos by the speed of the unit and the delta time.

#### What should happen after completing it:
Nothing in the scene should have changed.

### TODO 4

#### Solution explained
- The endPos is calculated by adding the movePos to the current position of the unit.
- The unit has a method to know if it would reach a tile during this move. It only needs the nextPos and the endPos to be passed as arguments.
- If the unit would reach the nextTile during this move, simply assign the nextPos to the current position of the unit and the nextTile to the currTile. Set the movement state of the unit to increase waypoint.
- If the unit would not reach the nextTile during this move, add the movePos to its current position.

#### What should happen after completing it
Units should be moving perfectly from one tile to the next one, until the reach their destinations. When moving, units will overlap each other, because there is no collision system running yet.

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9YKEKs1uElI" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe>

### TODO 5

#### Solution explained
a) Towards collision: the nextTile of the unit should match the currTile of the other unit and the nextTile of the other unit should match the currTile of this unit.
b) Its cell collision: the nextTile of the unit should match the currTile of the other unit.
c) Same cell collision: the nextTile of the unit should match the nextTile of the other unit.

#### What should happen after completing it (and having uncommented the bonus code)
If two units collide while moving, the unit that waits for the other unit will wait forever, since we have not set yet the appropriate conditions to resolve the collisions found.

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HSwNaQVSvAw" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe>

### TODO 6

#### Solution explained
a) Towards collision: units get stuck, so it is needed to find a new, valid nextTile for the unit by calling a method that changes the next tile of a unit.
b) Its cell collision: check if the currTile of the other unit is no longer the conflict cell.
c) Same cell collision: check if the nextTile of the other unit is no longer the conflict cell.
d) Diagonal crossing: check if the currTile of the other unit is the conflict cell.

#### What should happen after completing it (and having uncommented the bonus code)
The units should move considering the other units. This means that units will collide between themselves and resolve this collisions by either waiting for the other unit to pass or repathing an alternate route.

### Homework (optional)

If this research caught your eye and you want to keep practising, I suggest you to try to add one or all of the following improvements to the group movement system.

**1. EASY:** make your system consider other dynamic obstacles (like buildings), not just units. What if the map changes and the path is no longer optimal (or possible)? If you clicked your unit to go across the map and suddenly a building gets placed in the middle of its way, the original path calculated can no longer be considered accurate (because it was generated before the building was placed).

**2. MID:** add formations to your system:
- In contrast to groups, there are no internal collisions within the formation. If any space is left between some units, a non-grouped unit cannot occupy it.
- Rules can be implemented to allow formations to break and reform on the other side of an obstacle if no path around the obstacle can be found, and/or to reshape.

Check out how _Rise of Nations_ (2003) does formations! When you click on your destination, if you hold the mouse button down and drag, small circles are drawn on the tiles, showing the formation that the selected units would made.

**3. HARD:** if two groups of enemy units bump into each other while following their paths, make the units attack the units of the other group. Each of the units should choose another unit to attack. The other unit should have the same level or less than the unit that is attacking it. If a unit runs low in health, make it go away. When the battle is over, the remaining units (if any) should keep following their path to their initial destination.
